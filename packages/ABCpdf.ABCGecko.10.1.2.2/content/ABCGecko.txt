Important:


The ABCGecko engine consists of two parts:

1) The "ABCGeckoWP.exe" worker process

2) The "XULRunner37_0" folder



Visual Studio will automatically copy the worker process executable to your output directory.

However the XULRunner folder contains too many items for Visual Studio to do this efficiently.

As such you should manually copy the XULRunner folder to your output directory.



Alternatively you can use an ABCpdf10 config section in your config file to instruct ABCpdf where to find the XULRunner folder.

There are details in the ABCpdf documentation under SetConfigSection and XULRunnerDirectory.



In later versions of Visual Studio, security restrictions may prevent the setup scripts from running.

If this happens, in addition to the XULRunner folder, you will also need to manually copy ABCGeckoWP.exe to your bin directory.

Alternatively you can select the file in the project and change the "Copy to Output Directory" property to "Copy if newer".
